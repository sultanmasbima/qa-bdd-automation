# Automation Flow Overview

1. Test cases are first designed using Gherkin (BDD) format.
2. Scenarios are executed manually during the SIT phase to validate functionality.
3. After SIT sign-off, scenarios are mapped with automation methods in IntelliJ.
4. Automation scripts are executed during UAT to ensure stability before production.
5. Results are reported back to Jira for traceability.

This approach ensures strong collaboration between QA, developers, and SDET, 
while maintaining test coverage across different testing phases.
